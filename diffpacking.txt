+- mst_equipment_tank for tank
+- inv_movement for record movement
+- inv_movement_line for movement line 
+
+### data usage
+- Saves packing events via inv_movements + inv_movement_lines.
+- Loads packing events from inv_movements where meta.source = 'packing' and meta.batch_id = <batchId>.
+- Soft-deletes by setting inv_movements.status = 'void'.
+- Uses UOM conversions for both package and volume calculations.
+- Stores UI detail in inv_movements.meta (e.g., packing_type, volume_qty, volume_uom, filling_lines, etc.) for display/edit.
+
+### doc_type mapping:
+- Movement
+  filling → production_receipt
+  ship → sale
+  transfer → transfer
+  loss → adjustment
+  dispose → waste
+  dest_site_id: set to movement_site_id for ship/transfer/filling; src_site_id is left null (needs your rule).
+- Movement lines:
+
+Filling: line per package; qty = unit_count * unit_volume(L); uom_id = liters UOM.
+Volume-only (ship/transfer/loss/dispose): a single line using a default package (currently first package in mst_package — TODO in code).
