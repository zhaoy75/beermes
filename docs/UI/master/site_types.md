-site information is stored in registry_def table with kind = 'site_type'
-the page should list all site type in a table with columns name, inventory_count_flg, description, created_at

-the page should have a button to add new site type
-only admin user can edit data with system scope
-there should be a delete button to delete site type record
-validate check is needed for data Type
